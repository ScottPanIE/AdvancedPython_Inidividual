Convert BikeSharing Washington D.C. project to Dask DataFrame

All the datasets related to this project have been saved to gist, except the dataset about the information of the shared bike stations in Washington D.C.. The related features will not be used in modeling part of this assignment.Because it will not improve the model too much.

The Gradient Boost and the Random Forest models are not affected by the absence of the additional data mentioned in the previous part. However, the linear model is able to reach the maximum of 88% of R-square on the holdout dataset. (With the additional station information, the linear model is able to reach 90% of R-square on the holdout dataset).
